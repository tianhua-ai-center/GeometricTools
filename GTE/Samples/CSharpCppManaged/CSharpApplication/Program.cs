// The framework is based on the nicely written article "Creating a C++/CLI wrapper",
// https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/dotnet/net-development/creating-ccli-wrapper/
// by Mircea Oprea.  If you read this article, the native library originally was
// created as a dynamic library, but that has an overstrike and is replaced by a
// static library.  This is a consequence of the discussion at the end of the article
// where Maxence points out that this avoids DLL export problems.  However, as Maxence
// says, you can add __declspec(dllexport) tags to the functions you want exported so
// that the DLL is actually generated by the native library (in this solution, the
// CppLibrary).
//
// BEFORE BUILDING, change the configuration to Release and the architecture type
// to x64.  If you choose to run x86, you must launch the properties dialog for
// the CSharpApplication project.  Select the Build item and change the platform
// architecture from x64 to x86.  I do not know enough about mixed-language project
// management in Visual Studio to figure out whether this can happen automatically
// by selecting the config/architecture UI control from the Visual Studio toolbar.
// Do not use the DebugGL4 or ReleaseGL4; these are part of GTEngine and  are not
// hooked up via the configuration manager.  BEFORE RUNNING, set the start-up
// project to CSharpApplication; right-click that project and choose
// "Set as Startup Project".

            //var wkt = prepair.MakeValid("POLYGON((0 0, 10 0, 15 5, 10 0, 10 10, 0 10, 0 0))");
            //var wktReader = new WKTReader();
            //var geometry = wktReader.Read(wkt);

            //PipeDiagramTest t = new PipeDiagramTest(new CLI.ThPipeSystemDiagramMgd());
            //t.TestProcessMainBranchs();
            //t.TestProcessGrouping();
